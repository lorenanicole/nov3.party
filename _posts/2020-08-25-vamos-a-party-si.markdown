# November 3rd
I want to hear about your plans. For how we celebrate the goodbye of a specific Prez. 

I am working on a specific fun madlib, errr fun outcome maker for this. 

Or, if you just want to submit your stories .... Lore is here to listen!


<br /><br />python:
{% highlight python %}
def fffffff_2020(anger):
  print(f'(We all need this express yourself => {anger}))
{% endhighlight %}
