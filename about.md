# Why?
<br>

2020 is a year.

<br>
Let's just find a damn day to:
<br>

- Dance
- Partake in fun legally mind expanding opportunities (e.g. weed, voting, food, mutally agreeable *aka consenstual* lust)
- Cry 
- Whatever the hell you wanna do

<br>
We got you.
<br>

We are gonna party on Novembver 3 2020. 

<br>
## Pero, Lore, I love the theme!

<br>
This theme is dope, check it out => [here](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console).

## Questions?
<br>
In no particular order ...
<br>

1. Black Lives Matter.
2. Patriachy sucks.
3. At *least* $15 USD a hour for a liveable wage.
4. Refugees and immigrants, are ALWAYS, welcome en los EEUU.
5. Sexuality is about consent. Sex work is real. F your opinions about reproductive health, because the only voices that matter are between the pregnant person and their healthcare provider. It also doesn't matter if you don't agree. It's not about you.
<br>
6. WEAR A DAMN MASK. CORRECTLY.
<br>
<br>
<br>

Oh more questions?
