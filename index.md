# BIENVENDIXS!
<br>
2020 is a thing.
<br>
Tell me your November 3 2020 plan. I only want to know it in a text form, to start, but if you include gifs or images (this is obviously based on consent and proper vetting) I can update this to be more than just a text based site.
<br>
So when one prepares for the "Prez" to go away ... what do you do? Do you: 
<br><br>
- Buy a donkey
- Drink so silly you have a vision of a diety you always wanted to see
- Write some great research
- Get super fit?
- Make a thirst trap so inticing that we all can't help ourselves
<br>
<br>
What do you do? I want to know. Please share, and let's keep the momemtum going. November 3 2020 *MUST* be a party, regardless of the outcome.
